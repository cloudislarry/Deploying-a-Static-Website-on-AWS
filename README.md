# Deploying-a-Static-Website-on-AWS
## Project Overview
This project focuses on:

 1. Hosting a static website on S3
 2. Accessing the cached website pages using CloudFront content delivery network (CDN) service with error page implemented.

**The steps I took to achieve this**:
 -Creating a public S3 bucket and upload the website files to your bucket.
 -Configuring the bucket for website hosting and secure it with IAM policies.
 - Speed up content delivery using AWS's content distribution network.
 - Ensure website is accessible.
